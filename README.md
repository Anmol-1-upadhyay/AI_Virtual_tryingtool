# AI Virtual Try-On Tool

## Overview
AI Virtual Try-On Tool is an advanced AI-powered application that enables users to virtually try on outfits, accessories, and other wearable items using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project leverages cutting-edge AI models to provide a seamless and realistic virtual dressing experience.

## Features
- **Virtual Try-On:** Apply clothing items to user images in real-time.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes state-of-the-art image processing models for realistic apparel fitting.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for easy navigation and customization.
- **Multi-Category Support:** Works with multiple categories, including apparel, accessories, and footwear.
- **Customizable Fitting:** Users can fine-tune the fitting experience for better accuracy.

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask / FastAPI (for serving AI models and handling requests)
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning-based apparel fitting)
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, PIL, NumPy (for image manipulation and processing)
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL (if required for user sessions and storage)

### AI & Computer Vision
- **Pose Estimation:** MediaPipe / OpenPose (for accurate body landmark detection)
- **Image Segmentation:** U-Net / Mask R-CNN (for isolating clothing items and applying overlays)
- **Style Transfer:** GANs / CycleGAN (for realistic cloth fitting and adaptation)
- **Facial Recognition:** Dlib / FaceNet (for ensuring accurate positioning of accessories)

### Frontend
- **User Interface:** Streamlit / React (for a seamless web-based virtual try-on experience)
- **Interactive Elements:** Three.js / WebGL (for 3D rendering of apparel and accessories)
- **REST API Integration:** Axios / Fetch API (for communication between frontend and backend)

### Deployment
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS EC2 / Google Cloud / Azure (for hosting the backend models)
- **Containerization:** Docker (for easy deployment and scalability)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / Jenkins (for automated testing and deployment)
- **Database Management:** Firebase / PostgreSQL (for storing user data and preferences)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anmol-1-upadhyay/AI_Virtual_tryingtool.git
   cd AI_Virtual_tryingtool
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py  # Or streamlit run app.py if using Streamlit
   ```

## Usage
1. Upload an image of yourself.
2. Select the clothing item or accessory you want to try on.
3. Adjust positioning and scaling as needed.
4. View the final fitted result and save if necessary.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve AI accuracy using GAN-based models.
- Integrate AR support for real-time try-ons.
- Expand dataset for more apparel options.
- Implement mobile compatibility.
